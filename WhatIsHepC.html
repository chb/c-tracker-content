<h1>What is Hepatitis C?</h1>

<p>
	Hepatitis C is a liver disease cause by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV).
	Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus.
</p>
<p>
	Most people with hepatitis C are in the “baby-boomer” generation and acquired their infections decades ago.
	Today, most people with new HCV infections become infected with the HCV by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs.
	For a minority of people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness, but for 70%–85% of people who become infected with hepatitis C, long-term, chronic infection follows.
	Although not everyone with chronic hepatitis C progresses to serious liver disease, chronic hepatitis C can be a serious disease than can result in long-term health problems, including liver scarring (which can lead to cirrhosis), liver failure, liver cancer, even death.
	The majority of infected persons might not be aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill.
</p>
<p>
	There is no vaccine for hepatitis C.
	The best way to prevent hepatitis C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease, especially injecting drugs.
	Fortunately, highly effective, very well tolerated oral medications are available that, effectively, can cure hepatitis C, but their high cost has limited their broad application.
