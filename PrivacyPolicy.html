<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
	The team at CHIP (the Boston Children’s Hospital <i>Computational Health Informatics Program</i>) takes your privacy very seriously and we’re conscious about how we handle your data.
	In this privacy policy we’ll explain what data the C Tracker app (the “App”) collects, how it is transported over the internet and how it can or can not be linked to individual users.
</p>
<p>
	By using the App you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy.
	You also consent that we collect, use, and share your information as described in this privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using the App.
	This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or institutions that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
</p>
<p>
	Your use of the App will allow you to provide us with Personal Information, including but not limited to information about your overall health, medications you are taking, and physical fitness.
	The App collects your Personal Information for the purposes of a research study being conducted by Boston Children’s Hospital called C Tracker (the “Study”).
	<strong>If you choose to use the App to provide us with any Personal Information, you must first review and acknowledge the informed consent form for the Study, which will be presented to you within the App.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the App.
	If you are under 18, you must not attempt to register for the App and you must not send any information about yourself to us, including but not limited to your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
	In the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a person under age 18, we will delete that information.
	If you believe that we might have any information from or about a person under the age of 18, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu">CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>What information does the App collect?</h2>
<p>
	The App will obtain information from you in two ways.
	The first is information that you manually enter into the app.
	The second is information that the app collects automatically about you.
</p>
<h3>Information you manually enter into the App</h3>
<p>
	We receive and store some information you manually enter into the App.
	We do not collect Personal Information that directly identifies you, such as your name and birth date.
	Your name is only shown inside the app, and we only collect your birth year, conforming to the HIPAA Privacy Rule<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/De-identification/guidance.html"><sup>1</sup></a>.
	Instead, when you first use the app, a random number is created which will be used by us to know that the different information sent to us belongs to the same person.
</p>
<p>
	In addition to directly identifiable Personal Information, we ask you to enter information including gender, weight and height.
	Information collected when you answer questionnaires may contain information about your medications, your insurance, how you feel and perform at your workplace and your wellness and activity.
	In the future we may collect additional health-related information as the App and the surveys presented to you are further developed.
	You can choose not to provide us with certain information by not providing this information in the “You” section inside the App, or simply by skipping questions that you are uncomfortable answering.
</p>
<h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
<p>
	In addition to the Personal Information that you manually enter, the App also collects certain Personal Information about you automatically through your smartphone and/or any other wearable device which you use during the Study.
	For example, the App will interface with your smartphone or wearable device’s sensors (accelerometers, gyroscope, barometer, etc.) to collect the following information:
	<ul>
		<li>Your activity type and level</li>
		<li>The amount of time you spend sedentary or sleeping</li>
	</ul>
	This data will be automatically uploaded when you complete a survey.
</p>
<p>
	The App may also collect information about your location, including real-time location, through your smartphone or wearable device’s applicable geolocation, GPS, wi-fi or similar capabilities (“Location Information”).
	We will use the Location Information only when you sign up for the study to determine the state you live in.
	The App will not store your Location Information.
</p>
<p>
	The App may also automatically receive technical information relating to your usage of the App such as your operating system, device, features used, content viewed and downloaded, the dates and times of your interactions with the App and other information.
	We may use this information to understand, customize and improve user experience with the App and the Study.
	For example, we may engage analytics services to analyze this information in order to help us understand how users engage with and navigate the App, how and when features within the App are used and by how many users.
	This information cannot be linked to you nor to the data you provide as part of the research study.
</p>

<h2>Push Notifications</h2>
<p>
	“Push notifications” are messages that are sent to your smartphone to remind you of what you need to do in the Study.
	The App will send you push notifications throughout your participating in the Study, to make sure that you know to do certain things as part of the Study.
	You can choose to disable notifications in settings.
</p>

<h2>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h2>
<p>
	All information collected through the App is encrypted on your device.
	This makes it virtually impossible for anyone except the study organizers to read your information.
	Encrypted data is then sent to a server run by Boston Children’s Hospital and hosted by Amazon, then forwarded to a secure database hosted at Boston Children’s Hospital.
</p>
<p>
	Because your data only contains your random number, researchers using the data will not be able to identify individuals participating in the study.
</p>
<p>
	Access to the App on your smartphone is protected by Touch ID or the passcode you selected after you downloaded the app.
	One of these needs to be entered every time you access the App the first time after a few minutes.
	You should take steps to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your Touch ID and passcode appropriately and limiting access to your smartphone.
</p>
<p>
	We endeavor to protect the privacy of the Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security.
	Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your Personal Information at any time.
</p>
<p>
	All information collected by the App will be processed in the United States.
	During the study, only Boston Children’s Hospital and contractors engaged by Boston Children’s Hospital will be able to compile data you generate or provide through or with the App.
	You should only transmit data for the Study if you are in the United States at the time you transmit such data.
	You should be aware that the laws in the United States may not protect your privacy to the same extent as the laws in the country from which you have transmitted data to the App.
</p>

<h2>Will Boston Children’s Hospital share any of the information it receives?</h2>
<p>
	If you have granted us permission to do so in the informed consent form for the Study, we may share your coded study data (data not containing your name nor date of birth) with researchers outside of Boston Children’s Hospital under criteria established by Boston Children’s Hospital.
</p>
<p>
	The information collected by the App will not be shared with or sold for advertising purposes.
</p>
<p>
	If required by law, your study information may be disclosed to United States Department of Health and Human Services agencies, the Office for Human Research Protection, and other agencies as required by law.
	Also, the Institutional Review Board at Boston Children’s Hospital, which monitors the safety and conduct of human research, can look at the study information.
</p>

<h2>What Personal Information can I access?</h2>
<p>
	Through the App, you may access, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:
	<ul>
		<li>name (only visible in the app, never sent to us)</li>
		<li>gender and date of birth</li>
		<li>your height and weight</li>
	</ul>
	Your weight may be periodically updated by reading your latest entry from HealthKit.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>When you update or delete information in the App, information already sent to us during previous data collections will persist and cannot be changed or updated.</strong>
	The information you can view and update may change as the App undergoes further development.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu">CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>What choices do I have?</h2>
<p>
	You may choose not to install the App.
	If you choose not to install the App, you will be unable to participate in the Study.
</p>
<p>
	You may stop all collection of information by the App at any time by withdrawing from the study on the “You” page within the App or uninstalling the App.
	If you uninstall the App, we will retain all of information about you that was collected prior to that point and continue to use such information as described in this Privacy Policy.
	We will not be able to restore your data after you have withdrawn from the study or uninstalled the app.
</p>
<p>
	If you have questions about withdrawing, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu">CTracker@childrens.harvard.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Re-Contact</h2>
<p>
	Since we do not collect your name, address or email address, we are unable to contact you should we desire to do so.
	If you use the App’s built-in help system to ask us a question, we will be able to reply to you but will not know your name, address, phone number or email address.
	Should you contact us by email we will be able to see your email address and respond to you accordingly.
</p>

<h2>What limitations are there on my use of the App?</h2>
<p>
	When you download the App, you receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license (without the right to sublicense) to install and use one copy of the App solely for your personal, non-commercial use in connection with the Study.
	You must own or control the device on which you download the App.

	You understand that the App or portions of it may be subject to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property protection and that the ownership of software and other intellectual property related to the App, as well the goodwill associated therewith, remains with Boston Children’s Hospital or its licensors.
	You agree that any improvements or other changes to the App or the Study itself are the sole property of Boston Children’s Hospital.
